The project focuses on a thorough analysis and comparison of various electric vehicle models, examining their specifications, pricing, and additional features across different regions. By extracting and analyzing data from sources such as the EV Database, the project seeks to identify trends and patterns within the market, compare and contrast models, and provide insights into the factors influencing EV pricing.

Key objectives include developing a predictive model to estimate EV prices based on main specifications and features, performing descriptive analysis to highlight market trends, and engineering new features to enhance model performance. The methodology involves data extraction, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, feature
engineering, model development using regression and testing techniques, model validations.

Through our analysis, we identified factors influencing the EV Price in four countries i.e. US, Germany, UK and Nedtherlands.

For consumers, this project provides a framework for making informed purchasing decisions. By
understanding the main factors that drive EV pricing, consumers can better prioritize their needs and make cost-effective choices. The insights into regional variations further guide consumers towards markets offering the best value, which could in future help in checking the import price as well for consumers looking for this option.

For a regional consumer, these prediction models, help in understanding the key predictor for the EV price and their requirement based on their countryâ€™s infrastructure.

Manufacturers can leverage the findings to refine their product strategies, focusing on features that align with consumer preferences and market demands. Additionally, policymakers can use these insights to design targeted incentives and infrastructure investments that promote EV adoption and support sustainable transportation goals.
